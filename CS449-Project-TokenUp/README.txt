Running the app:
The app should run such as any other in Android Studio through the Run menu. Since the phone used for debugging was a Samsung Galaxy S6, the emulation the app was tested on was also a Samsung S6 skin.
Should the app have any problems with emulation on other skins, please follow the official Samsung tutorial for implementing the S6 skin: https://developer.samsung.com/technical-doc/view.do?v=T000000095

Select Token:
One may select a token by navigating to the Select Token -> Browse Tokens menu. Afterwards, tokens can be searched for or browsed by categories.
After a token or tokens have been selected, they may be reselected later from the Select Token -> Recently Used menu.

Manipulating Tokens:
After a token is selected, the total amount of tokens in play can be increased or decreased by the very bottom plus and minus signs. The "total" button may also be clicked to manually input the number of tokens and their phase.
After the total has been increased, the tokens can be manipulated with the menus above the total button. From left to right, the icons represent:
Attacking tokens, blocking tokens, ready tokens, summoning sick tokens, and tapped tokens.
The "pass turn" and "new upkeep" buttons can be used to automatically tap/ready/unsummoning sick tokens as they would in a normal game of Magic.

Adding Effects:
Effects from other cards can be added through the 'Effects' button. This will open up a pane to view any active ones and a button to create new ones. The number they effect can be decremented and incremented.
Because the effects don't necessarily affect all tokens in play, it is simply to keep track of the number manually. Even if a "haste" effect is on, for example, new tokens will still come in with summoning sickness. The number of tokens must be changed manually to avoid this.

Create Token:
New tokens can be created in the "Create Token" menu. This will require an image and ID. After creation, the token can be found much like any other.
